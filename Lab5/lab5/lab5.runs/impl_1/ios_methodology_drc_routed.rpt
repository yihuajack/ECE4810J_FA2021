2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.310 ns between U0/led_ctl_i0/led_o_reg[1]/C (clocked by clk_pin) and led_pins[1] (clocked by clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.343 ns between U0/led_ctl_i0/led_o_reg[0]/C (clocked by clk_pin) and led_pins[0] (clocked by clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#3 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.355 ns between U0/led_ctl_i0/led_o_reg[7]/C (clocked by clk_pin) and led_pins[7] (clocked by clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#4 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.361 ns between U0/led_ctl_i0/led_o_reg[6]/C (clocked by clk_pin) and led_pins[6] (clocked by clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#5 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.391 ns between U0/led_ctl_i0/led_o_reg[5]/C (clocked by clk_pin) and led_pins[5] (clocked by clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#6 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.403 ns between U0/led_ctl_i0/led_o_reg[4]/C (clocked by clk_pin) and led_pins[4] (clocked by clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#7 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.519 ns between U0/led_ctl_i0/led_o_reg[2]/C (clocked by clk_pin) and led_pins[2] (clocked by clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#8 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.529 ns between U0/led_ctl_i0/led_o_reg[3]/C (clocked by clk_pin) and led_pins[3] (clocked by clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
