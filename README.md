\* Group 2 Project Grade: 89  individual grade: 81 (for limited contribution to this project) 1. Functionality Correctness 38 Functionality was correctly verified, coefficient was generated through Matlab. Different architectures were implemented. But the verification is mostly done at the matlab level.  2. Evaluation Methodology & Results 12 The evaluation is based on simulation and FPGA emulation. Results were presented, and comparisons were made. But there are no detailed analysis about the results. 3. Presentation and Demo 12 Presentation and demo were done correctly in most of the part, and the results were not clearly explained. Several questions were not well answered. 4. Report 8 FPGA setup is just a picture of the board? Refences for the figures that are taken from others? 5. Source code 18 Bonus: 1 (for implementing 3 different architectures)
